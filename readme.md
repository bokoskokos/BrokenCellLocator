### Broken Cell Locator ###

# Generates a number of random images each with a 10x5 (A-J, 1-5) pannel where each cell is either healthy (black) or dead (red)
# The size of the pannel varies, and may not fit into the 200x200 px viewport
# The images are then analysed and an attempt is made to report on which cells are dead
